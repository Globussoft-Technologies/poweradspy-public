# AI-Meta & Category Read-Back — API Implementation

**Status:** Implemented · **Date:** 2026-07-01, updated for spec v1.5 (2026-07-10) and v1.6 (2026-07-13) · **Owner:** Anij Burnwal
**Spec:** `AI_META_API_PAYLOAD_SPEC.md` **v1.6** · **Backend issues:** `BACKEND_FIX_PROMPT.md` (Issues 1 & 3)

This document describes two related pieces of work on the shared classifier controller
[`src/services/common/controllers/addCategoryController.js`](../src/services/common/controllers/addCategoryController.js):

1. **Extension of the existing category API** (`newCatInsertion` + `getDescriptionDetails`) — read-back, ad-level status, a new single-ad read-back endpoint, and optional `ai_meta` acceptance (Option A).
2. **A new dedicated AI-Meta endpoint** (`POST /ai-meta`, Option B) plus a reusable validator.

All endpoints are **internal (no auth)**, mounted under `/api/v1/common` in
[`commonRoutes.js`](../src/services/common/routes/commonRoutes.js), and documented in `swagger.yml`.

---

## 0. Background — why this was needed

The ad-classification pipeline fetches ads from `getDescriptionDetails`, classifies them, and
POSTs labels back to `newCatInsertion`. Two things blocked it:

- **No read-back.** `newCatInsertion` *did* write the category onto the ad, but nothing ever
  returned it. The classifier re-fetched the feed, saw no category, and concluded the write had
  failed — so it re-processed every ad forever. The response message (`"Category and Subcategory
  already exist"`) described the **master taxonomy index**, not the ad, which made two different
  categories POSTed to the same ad both look like no-ops.
- **AI-Meta had nowhere to land.** The AI-Meta spec's write-back rides on the same endpoint, so it
  would have failed the same way until the read-back existed.

The canonical per-platform category field is the **literal dotted key** `${platform}.category` /
`${platform}.subCategory` (e.g. `facebook.category`, `youtube.category`, `native.category`) — this
is what the ad detail/list readers already consume, so both the write and the read-back use it.

---

## 1. Extension of the existing category API

### 1.1 `GET /getDescriptionDetails` — feed now returns stored labels

Each row in the response gained the following fields (additive — no existing field changed):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `category` | string \| null | Stored `${platform}.category` |
| `sub_category` | string \| null | Stored `${platform}.subCategory` |
| `category_id` | string \| null | Flat `category_id` |
| `subcategory_id` | string \| null | Flat `subCategory_id` |
| `confidence_score` | number \| null | `0` once a human/AI category is assigned |
| `ai_meta` | object \| null | Read-back of any stored AI-Meta enrichment (see §2), regardless of whether ES stored it under `ai` or `ai_meta` |
| `image_url_original` | string \| null | **Native only** — original scraped URL, fallback creative source |

**Image URLs are now resolvable.** `ad_image` and `thumbnail` are passed through a `served()`
helper that strips the stored NAS mount prefix (`/PowerAdspy/n2/…`, `pas-dev/stream`, `pas-prod/stream`)
and prepends the configured CDN base (`config.cdn.baseUrl` / `CDN_BASE_URL`). Already-absolute
`http(s)` URLs pass through untouched. This removes the client-side rewrite the classifier used to do.

**Native creative fallback (Issue 3).** For native `IMAGE` ads, `ad_image` now falls back to
`image_url_original` when the NAS copy is missing (`served(nasValue) ?? served(origValue) ?? null`),
and `image_url_original` is also surfaced on its own field. This lets the classifier recover backlog
ads whose NAS creative was never stored — *provided the scraper kept an original URL*. The native
ingestion pipeline itself faithfully stores whatever the scraper sends; the drop-to-zero at high
exvals is an **upstream payload/scraper problem**, not a storage regression in this service.

### 1.2 `POST /newCatInsertion` — ad-level status + optional `ai_meta`

**Request:** unchanged required fields (`platform`, `category`, `category_id`, `ad_id`,
optional `sub_category`/`subcategory_id`) **plus** an optional `ai_meta` object (§2).

**New response fields** (existing `code`/`message`/`ad_id`/`updated`/`warning` unchanged):

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ad_status` | `inserted` \| `updated` \| `unchanged` \| `not_found` \| `error` | What happened to the **ad record** — distinct from `message` (which is about the master taxonomy). Computed by comparing the ad's prior category before writing. |
| `ad_category` | string | The category just written |
| `ad_sub_category` | string \| null | The sub-category just written |
| `previous_category` | string \| null | The category the ad held before (present only if it had one) |
| `ai_meta_status` | see §2.4 | Present only when `ai_meta` was supplied |
| `ai_meta_stored_fields` | string[] | ai_meta keys written |
| `ai_meta_errors` | `{field,message}[]` | Present when `ai_meta_status = validation_error` |

The category write is a **doc-merge** (`{ doc: { … } }`) with `refresh: wait_for`, so a subsequent
POST of a *different* category overwrites the previous one and is immediately searchable.

### 1.3 `GET /getAdCategory?platform=&ad_id=` — single-ad read-back (new)

Verifies one ad without paging the whole feed. Matched on the same per-platform key
`newCatInsertion` writes to (`ad_id` for google/youtube, `<net>_ad.id` elsewhere).

```http
GET /api/v1/common/getAdCategory?platform=facebook&ad_id=13011
```
```json
{
  "code": 200, "platform": "facebook", "ad_id": "13011",
  "category": "Retail", "sub_category": "eCommerce",
  "category_id": "1234", "subcategory_id": "12340001",
  "confidence_score": 0,
  "ai_meta": { "ad_type": "promotional", "offering_type": "product", "...": "..." }
}
```
Responses: `200` (found), `400` (bad/missing platform or ad_id), `404` (ad not found), `503` (ES down).

---

## 2. AI-Meta enrichment

Implements `AI_META_API_PAYLOAD_SPEC.md` **v1.6** (2026-07-13). Data is stored on the ad's ES doc
under a single AI-Meta object (spec §7 mapping): normally the ES field is `ai`, but the
production Facebook index uses `ai_meta` to bypass the poisoned legacy mapping. Field set = 8 core (`ad_type`, `intent`, `hook`,
`offering_type`, `offers`, `offering`, `caption`, `roa`) + `colors` + the category classification group
(`category`/`category_id`/`sub_category`/`subcategory_id`).

> **Lineage vs the original v1.1 build:** `product_type`→**`offering_type`** (enum shrank to
> `product`/`service`/`both`); `reason`→**`roa`**; **added `caption`**; **removed** `object`,
> `language`, `ocr`, `brand_logos`, **`status`**, and — in **v1.5** — **`brand`** and **`celebrity`**.
> **v1.6:** the category name **and its ids** (`category_id` 4-char, `subcategory_id` 8-char) now travel
> inside `ai_meta` — the top-level classification fields are retired — so `/ai-meta` can drive the flat ES
> ad-doc codes and maintain the master `category` taxonomy index on its own. With `status` gone there is no
> partial/failed state — every payload is a completed enrichment, so the whole `ai_meta` object is always
> replaced. `colors` is a fixed **16-value HEX palette** (not the never-shipped named-word vocab).

### 2.1 Validator — `src/services/common/helpers/aiMetaValidator.js`

`validateAiMeta(aiMeta)` → `{ errors: [{field,message}], normalized, storedFields }`.
Pure/synchronous, fully unit-tested. Enforces the entire §3 contract:

- **Required core (always):** `ad_type`, `intent`, `hook`, `offering_type`. (No `status` field → no
  partial/failed relaxation; every payload must carry these.)
- **Enums:** `ad_type` (16), `intent` (11), `hook` (16), `offering_type` (`product`/`service`/`both`),
  `offer.type` (13), and the **16-value HEX `colors` palette** — named-word colors and off-palette hex
  are both rejected (compared case-insensitively, normalised to the palette's uppercase form).
- **Cardinality:** `intent`/`hook` 1–5, `colors` 0–3, `offers` ≤3; no duplicates.
- **Offers:** `value` required and `0–100` for `percentage_discount`, required and `≥0` for
  `flat_discount`, and forced to `null` for every other type.
- **Text:** `offering`/`caption` ≤200 (no newlines/control chars, empty → omitted); `roa` sub-fields
  (`intent`/`hook`/`offering_type`/`offering`) each ≤200, empties dropped, whole object omitted if all empty.
- **Category group (v1.6):** `category` (≥5) ↔ `category_id` (exactly 4) travel together; `sub_category`
  (≥2) ↔ `subcategory_id` (exactly 8, prefixed by `category_id`) travel together; a sub requires a parent
  category; a failed name/id pair drops **both** halves (no half-pairs); the whole group is optional.
- **Unknown fields ignored:** legacy/removed keys (`product_type`, `brand`, `celebrity`, …) are not
  errored, just dropped → a payload sending the old `product_type` instead of `offering_type` still fails
  because the now-required `offering_type` is missing, which is the intended rejection.

### 2.2 Option A — `ai_meta` on `newCatInsertion`

`newCatInsertion` accepts an optional `ai_meta` object alongside the (legacy top-level) category fields. It
is **additive and non-blocking**: an invalid `ai_meta` never fails the category write — it is reported via
`ai_meta_status: "validation_error"` + `ai_meta_errors`, while the category result stands. On success the
AI-Meta object is written and dual-persisted to SQL (`ai_meta_sql`). Category on this path is still driven by
the top-level classification (Step 1 taxonomy + Step 2 flat-code ad update), so the ai_meta category is not
re-applied here. **Once the DS pipeline ships v1.6, `/ai-meta` (Option B) is the intended single endpoint;**
Option A stays for backward compatibility.

### 2.3 Option B — `POST /ai-meta` (dedicated) — now the full category writer

Standalone, spec-conformant write path. **As of v1.6 it is no longer decoupled from category** — because
the category name + ids arrive inside `ai_meta`, this endpoint now, when a category is present:
1. writes the AI-Meta object to the environment/platform-appropriate ES field,
2. maintains the master `category` taxonomy index (shared `syncMasterCategory`, using `category_id`/
   `subcategory_id`),
3. mirrors the dotted names + flat 4/8-char codes onto the ad doc (`mirrorCategoryToEs`), and
4. dual-writes to SQL (`persistAiMeta`), syncing the category name to `<net>_ad.category_id` where a store
   exists.
Steps 2–3 are non-fatal and surfaced under `category_sync`; step 4 under `sql`.

**Request** (spec §2):
```json
{
  "ad_id": "531218",
  "network": "facebook",
  "ai_meta": {
    "ad_type": "promotional", "intent": ["conversion"], "hook": ["urgency"], "offering_type": "product",
    "category": "Retail", "category_id": "1234",
    "sub_category": "Specialty Stores", "subcategory_id": "12340001"
  }
}
```
`network` is required (alias `platform` also accepted). The category group is optional; when present it
must carry its ids (§2.1).

**Responses** (spec §6, verbatim shapes):

| Status | Body |
|---|---|
| `200` | `{ success:true, ad_id, message, stored_fields:[…], category_sync?:{taxonomy,mirrored}, sql:{sql_status,…} }` |
| `400` | `{ success:false, ad_id, error:{ code:"VALIDATION_ERROR", message, details:[{field,message}] } }` |
| `404` | `{ success:false, ad_id, error:{ code:"AD_NOT_FOUND", message } }` |
| `503` | `{ success:false, ad_id, error:{ code:"ES_UNAVAILABLE", message } }` |

### 2.4 Write policy — idempotency (both options)

A single painless script assigns the whole AI-Meta object atomically:

```painless
ctx._source.<resolved_ai_field> = params.aiMeta;
```

The object is **replaced** on every write (not doc-merged), so re-sending overwrites prior labels and
stale sub-fields from an older payload shape (e.g. a leftover `object`/`status`/`brand` from a v1.1–v1.4
write) are dropped. `status` was removed (v1.3), so there is no partial/failed path — every payload is a
completed enrichment. Written with `refresh: wait_for` so it is immediately searchable.

`ai_meta_status` (Option A) / outcome mapping:

| Value | When |
|---|---|
| `stored` | full AI-Meta object written |
| `validation_error` | payload failed validation (Option A only; Option B returns `400`) |
| `ad_not_found` | ad id not in the platform index (Option A only; Option B returns `404`) |
| `error` | ES update threw |

### 2.5 Read-back

The stored AI-Meta object is returned as `ai_meta` by both `GET /getDescriptionDetails` (feed) and
`GET /getAdCategory` (single ad), so the classifier can verify an enrichment write and skip
already-enriched ads.

### 2.6 SQL dual-write — `src/services/common/helpers/aiMetaSqlWriter.js`

ES is the search store; SQL is the durable system-of-record copy. `persistAiMeta({ sql, network, adId,
normalized, logger })` runs alongside every ES `writeAiMeta` (both options), in **one transaction**, and is
**non-fatal** — any failure returns a status object and never throws, so an ES success is never lost. Full
schema/design in `docs/AI_META_SQL_STORAGE.md`. In short:

- **Upsert** the validated `ai_meta` object into `<net>_ad_ai_meta` (1:1 with `<net>_ad`, keyed on the
  public `ad_id` → internal PK). JSON fields (`intent`/`hook`/`colors`/`offers`/`roa`) are `JSON.stringify`'d
  into `JSON` columns; absent fields bind SQL `NULL` (whole-object replace via `ON DUPLICATE KEY`).
- **Category dual-write:** category/sub_category (+ the v1.6 `category_id`/`subcategory_id`) come from the
  **`ai_meta` object** (the top-level `newCatInsertion` category is retired). When a category is present and
  the network has a SQL category store, the name is resolved to its `<net>_category.id` (SELECT-then-INSERT)
  and written to `<net>_ad.category_id`; the controller also maintains the master `category` taxonomy index
  (`syncMasterCategory`, using the ids) and mirrors the names + flat codes to the ad doc
  (`mirrorCategoryToEs`). **Only 7 networks have a SQL category store** (facebook, instagram, youtube,
  native, linkedin, reddit, quora); **gdn, google, pinterest, tiktok have none** → category stays ES-only
  there. `sub_category` has no SQL category-table home, so it lives only in `<net>_ad_ai_meta.sub_category`.
- **Status:** returned as `{ sql_status: 'stored'|'skipped'|'ad_not_found'|'error', sql_ad_row_id?,
  category_synced?, sql_error? }`, surfaced on the response as `ai_meta_sql` (Option A) / `sql` (Option B).

## 3. Decisions (spec §8 open questions)

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Endpoint choice | **Both** A (extend `newCatInsertion`) and B (dedicated `/ai-meta`), sharing one validator + writer. |
| 2 | Idempotency | **Overwrite** — the whole AI-Meta object is replaced on every write. (`status` was dropped, so the earlier partial/failed policy no longer applies.) |
| 3 | Indexing trigger | Direct ES write with `refresh: wait_for` — immediately searchable, no separate cron. |
| 4 | Durable store | **Dual-write to SQL** (`<net>_ad_ai_meta`) alongside ES, non-fatal. category/sub_category sourced from the `ai_meta` object; category also synced to the pre-existing `<net>_ad.category_id` store where one exists (7/11 networks). |
| 5 | Category location (v1.6) | Category **name + 4/8-char ids live inside `ai_meta`** (top-level classification fields retired). This lets **Option B (`/ai-meta`) be the single endpoint** — it maintains the taxonomy index and the flat ES codes from the ids. `newCatInsertion` (Option A) is kept as-is for backward compatibility; its taxonomy logic is now shared via `syncMasterCategory`. |

## 4. Tests

- `tests/services/common/helpers/aiMetaValidator.test.mjs` — validator (offering_type rename, hex
  colors, offers rules, `caption`/`roa`, cardinality, no-status, removed brand/celebrity ignored, and the
  v1.6 category group: name↔id pairing, 4/8-char formats, subcategory_id prefix, half-pair drop).
- `tests/services/common/controllers/addCategoryController.test.mjs` — feed read-back, native
  fallback, `ad_status` transitions, `getAdCategory`, `insertAiMeta` (200/400/404/503), Option-A
  `ai_meta` integration, and the SQL dual-write wiring (both options, ES category mirror, non-fatal).
- `tests/services/common/helpers/aiMetaSqlWriter.test.mjs` — `persistAiMeta` (upsert params, JSON NULL
  binding, category name→id resolve/insert, networks without a category store, rollback on error).
- `tests/services/common/routes/commonRoutes.test.mjs` — route registration.

Run:
```bash
npx vitest run tests/services/common
```
All `tests/services/common` suites green (615 tests).

## 5. Deployment notes

1. **ES mapping (spec §7):** apply the explicit AI-Meta mapping to each network's index **before** first
   write. The code writes the data regardless, but without the mapping ES 6.8 dynamic-maps sub-fields
   (e.g. `ai_meta.colors` as text+keyword, `ai_meta.offers.value` as `long`) — and a later type change would
   require a reindex. **Step-by-step runbook (per-network index list, ES 6.8 vs TikTok 8.x PUT forms,
   curl/Kibana/Node-script methods, verification, reindex fallback): [`AI_META_ES_MAPPING_RUNBOOK.md`](./AI_META_ES_MAPPING_RUNBOOK.md).**
2. **CDN base:** `getDescriptionDetails` image resolution needs `config.cdn.baseUrl` (or
   `CDN_BASE_URL`) set; if empty, NAS-relative paths are returned unchanged (no regression).
3. **Native backlog:** the `image_url_original` fallback only helps ads that actually kept an
   original URL. Ads whose creative was never captured upstream cannot be recovered from this service
   — that requires the scraper/source team.
4. **SQL tables (dual-write):** apply the per-network `<net>_ad_ai_meta` DDL from
   [`AI_META_SQL_STORAGE.md`](./AI_META_SQL_STORAGE.md) **before** go-live. Until the table exists,
   `persistAiMeta` returns `{ sql_status: 'error' }` — non-fatal (ES still succeeds), but no durable copy
   is written. Take the schema name from `networks.<net>.sql.database` per environment.
